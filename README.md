# Team Jishui COVID-19 Information Dashboard

## Dashboard Overview

Our COVID-19 information dashboard is a web application that shows general COVID-19 data for the entirety of the United States. This data includes the number of Cases, the number of Recoveries, 
the number of Active Cases, and the number of Deaths due to Coronavirus within the United States. The website also has a bar graph and a pie chart that display the Recovered Cases to Deaths ratio and 
the Deaths and Recovered Cases that occurred today. Users can create an account on our site to keep up with this information.

## How To Use the Dashboard

Run `npm install` when you enter the website directory.\

To start the website, use `npm start` in the root website directory, which will start the app at `localhost:3000/`. 
From there you will be able to view the available COVID-19 data.\

You can also create an account using our Login and Signup pages (Currently a work-in-progress, the actual process is on the main page)!
